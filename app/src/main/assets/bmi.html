<table style="width:80%; font-size:120%;">
    <colgroup>
        <col span="2" style="background-color:#FFFBBB">
    </colgroup>
    <tr>
        <th> BMI</th>
        <th>Weight (Kg)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>_____________________</th>

<table style="width:80%; font-size:130%;">
    <colgroup>
        <col span="2" style="background-color:#FFFBBB">
    </colgroup>
    <tr>
        <th> 34.6</th>
        <th>100 (Kg)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>_____________________</th>
        <th>1.7(m) × 1.7 (m)</th>
