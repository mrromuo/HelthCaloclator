<h1>Target Heart Rate and Estimated Maximum Heart Rate</h1>

<p style="font-size:130%;">
    For moderate-intensity physical activity, your target heart rate should be between 64% and
    76%1,2 of your maximum heart rate. You can estimate your maximum heart rate based on your age.
    To estimate your maximum age-related heart rate, subtract your age from 220. For example, for a
    50-year-old person, the estimated maximum age-related heart rate would be calculated as 220 – 50
    years = 170 beats per minute (bpm). The 64% and 76% levels would be:
</p>
<ul style="font-size:130%;">
    <li>64% level: 170 x 0.64 = 109 bpm, and</li>
    <li>76% level: 170 x 0.76 = 129 bpm</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:130%;">
    This shows that moderate-intensity physical activity for a 50-year-old person will
    require that the heart rate remains between 109 and 129 bpm during physical activity.
</p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">

    For vigorous-intensity physical activity, your target heart rate should be between 77%
    and 93%1,2 of your maximum heart rate. To figure out this range, follow the same formula
    used above, except change “64 and 76%” to “77 and 93%”. For example, for a 35-year-old
    person, the estimated maximum age-related heart rate would be calculated as 220 – 35
    years = 185 beats per minute (bpm). The 77% and 93% levels would be:
</p>
<ul style="font-size:130%;">
    <li>77% level: 185 x 0.77 = 142 bpm, and</li>
    <li>93% level: 185 x 0.93 = 172 bpm</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:130%;">
    This shows that vigorous-intensity physical activity for a 35-year-old person
    will require that the heart rate remains between 142 and 172 bpm during physical
    activity
